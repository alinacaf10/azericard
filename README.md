# Azericard Project
The main purpose of the project is User authentication management, Card operation Management, Payments and Product management.

## Project Description<br>
This project involves developing a microservices-based system to manage user authentication, card operations, payments, and product information retrieval. The system consists of four microservices: User, Card, Payment, and Product, each catering to specific functionalities.<br>

## Tech Stack<br>
- **Java**: Main programming language for backend services.<br>
- **Spring Boot**: Framework used for developing microservices.<br>
- **JWT**: For user authentication.<br>
- **PostgreSQL**: RDBMS for data storage.<br>
- **Docker Compose**: Framework for container orchestration.<br>
- **Postman**: Optional for API testing.<br>

## Prerequisites

If you want to run an application without getting any problem, follow the steps below: 

- Java 17
- Docker
- Intelij IDEA 

## Overall Architecture<br>
The system follows a microservices architecture where each service handles a specific aspect of the application. User service manages authentication and user-related operations, Card service deals with card management, Payment service handles payment processing, and Product service manages product information.<br>

## How to Run<br>
1. Clone the repository.<br>
2. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.<br>
3. Navigate to the project directory.<br>
4. Run `docker-compose up` to start the microservices.<br>
5. Access the services through their respective endpoints.<br>

Run docker-compose up to start the microservices.
Access the services through their respective endpoints.
